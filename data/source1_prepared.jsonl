{"prompt":"How are Distance Learning courses conducted? What are their requirements?","completion":" Distance Learning courses can be attended through a web-based platform (Moodle) that you have access to when you have formally enrolled in the programme. Through this platform, you have access to the material of your chosen courses for the corresponding semester. Each course consists of lectures, assignments and a final assessment. Lectures and assignments are delivered through the online platform. In each course, there is the corresponding online 'Forum', in which you can communicate with both the lecturer and your fellow students. You can also communicate directly with your lecturer, whose contact information is permanently posted on the Moodle platform. Every programme also has an 'Announcement Forum', in which announcements on important academic and administrative issues are posted throughout each semester. \n"}
